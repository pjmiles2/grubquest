# grubquest

GrubQuest is a program that helps a user narrow down choices for going out to eat and the cost to get there on Uber. 

Helps to solve the question of “what do you want to eat tonight?” and the back and forth that results from that question. 

This program helps to weed out places and categories to help you make a quick decision.
